#PageRank_Python

This project is part of a scholar course in order to implement the pagerank algorithm and use it on a graph data.
We used Neo4J DataBase to create and store the data with Cypher script Create_graph_Neo4J.txt.
We used a python script in order to calculate the pagerank pagerank.py. 
And for the data extraction, we used bash script getdata.bash.
All the program is executed with main.py
